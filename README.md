# Console ASCII Animation System

[Chang Liu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~changliu/index.html) \<<liuchangsmail@gmail.com>\>

The project is motivated as a birthday gift for Suki H. and is inspired by the [Yahoo! Logo ASCII Animation](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/06/26/obfuscated-c-yahoo-logo.html) code snippet (attached and parsed in the folder [`./refs/`](./refs/)) by [Andy Sloane](https://github.com/a1k0n/).
The project implements standard common basic shapes for building general shape objects.
